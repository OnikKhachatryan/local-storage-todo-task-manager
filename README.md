# LocalStorage Task List Application

This is a web-based Task List Application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app utilizes **localStorage** to save tasks and their states (such as completed or pending) so that they persist across page reloads. The project includes the following problems and solutions:
## Purpose
The **LocalStorage Task List Application** is designed to help users manage their tasks and todos directly in the browser. This simple yet effective web app stores tasks and their statuses (such as completed or pending) in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring that the data persists across page reloads. This project provides an interactive way to practice **JavaScript**, especially for  learning about **localStorage**, **DOM manipulation**, and **basic web development concepts**.



## Problems and Solutions:

### Problem 1: Save Items to LocalStorage
- **Problem 1A:** Save a single value to `localStorage` and retrieve it.
- **Problem 1B:** Task List with LocalStorage.
  - Users can add tasks, mark them as done, and delete them.
  - The tasks are stored in `localStorage`, so they persist across page reloads.

### Problem 2: Traffic Light Simulation
- Simulates a traffic light with a cycle of Red, Orange, and Green lights using `setInterval` and `setTimeout`.

### Problem 3: Simple List with LocalStorage
- Add items to a list that is stored in `localStorage`.
- Items are saved and visible after page reload.

### Problem 4: LocalStorage List with Delete Button
- Similar to Problem 3 but with a **Delete** button to remove items from the list.
- Items can be deleted, and the updated list is saved in `localStorage`.

### Problem 5: To-Do List with Done Toggle
- A To-Do list where tasks can be marked as done using a "Done" button.
- Tasks that are marked done are crossed out.
- Uses `localStorage` to save the state of the tasks.

### Problem 6: Done Toggle with Reload
- Similar to Problem 5, but the list reloads the page after marking a task as done.
- This ensures that changes persist, and the page is updated immediately.

## Features
- **localStorage**: Tasks and their states (done/pending) are saved in the browser's local storage.
- **Dynamic List**: Users can add, mark as done, and delete tasks.
- **Persistence**: Tasks persist across page reloads.
- **Traffic Light Simulation**: A fun simulation of a traffic light using simple JavaScript functions.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Use the input fields and buttons to add tasks, toggle their completion status, and delete tasks.
3. The changes will be saved in the browser's localStorage, so they remain after refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structure.
- **CSS** for styling.
- **JavaScript** for functionality, including `localStorage`, `setInterval`, and `setTimeout`.
